                <p>
                    We will start in 1261 when the land was taken by Alexander III of Scotland from Aleumus de Meser because the owners were not
                    meeting the demand of services required in order to keep in power of the land.

                <h1>The Flood of 1877</h1>
                <p class="text-warning"> 28 August 1877</p>
                <p>The burn in Tillicoultry burst its banks on the 28th August 1877. After having 12 hour of consistent rain fall.</p>
                <p> As a result of the burn bursting flooding was widespread throughout nearby towns. Crops and building were destroyed and workers
                    in mills were trapped as they could not safely exit their workplace. Houses and shops in the highstreet were under as much as 3 feet of water.

                <h6>The aftermath</h6>
                <p>Over Â£2,000 was required to repair the burn, atleast 2 people working in mills died and the village was deprived
                    of all gas and water for several weeks after the flood, taking a while to repair this.
                    <br>The flood was devistating for the village
