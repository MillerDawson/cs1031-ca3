### Why I chose this design?

##### Navbar:
I went with this navigation design because I feel like BS-dark works well with it's primary colour and the contrast of white in the paragraphs and headers allow a good view of the colour scheme. Dark themes are often greater for the eye during the night and can look very well during the day. 

I used Bootstrap on the navbar so that it was compatible with mobile devices and used some css later on in the website to demonstrate that I can use both bootsrap and my own CSS to make things compatabile through different device's.

##### Layout:
I centered all of the text throughout the pages to keep the style the same throughout all pages, creating several css styles for header-text, sHeader-text and paragraph-text which allowed me to keep the design consistent. 

##### Colour Choice:
This is my first time using boostrap and wanted to experiment with it's bg colours so I decided to use this colour scheme. Although it looks a little strange at first, I grew to like this colour scheme and prefer the way it looks on mobile, however on other devices it still lookss reasonably good.

### What Challenges I faced:

##### Information on Village:
Since Tillicoultry is a rural village with its closest "city" being Stirling, it was extremely hard to get information and images. Living in Aberdeen meant that I had to use my previous knowledge and scrape together all but little information I could on my home town. I was not able to get a lot of copy right free images, however the ones I could obtain are styled appropriately and work well with the information displayed on the website. This was a large part of my difficulty going through the website as the lack of information proved to be a hastle. 

##### Bootstrap 5:
I have used a lot of CSS before, however it was my first time using BS5 and wanted to make a majority of my website using BS5 to expand my knowledge on this. At first it was difficult to use however, through frequent checking of the BS5 document it allowed me to build everything to the user requirements and successfully complete the project. This assignment expanded my knowledge of BS5 significantly. 

##### Layout:
I did alot of experimentation with the layout of the website, running into the issue where I would not like a part of my website and would recode it. Constantly wanting to adapt it and use more styles. However, I feel like it has turned out well in the end and meet all user requirements.

##### Index Page:
I had to do a lot of adaptations for the images on the home page to be compatable with smaller devices and to limit on which devices the hover effect can be placed on. Originally I tried to do most of this in BS5 however I resorted to making my own CSS in the end and it wworked effectively.

# Overall

This assignment has increased my knowledge on Bootstrap 5 and allowed me to build a small compatabile website based on my home town Tillicoultry. It was enjoyable and my problem solving skills allowed me to adapt to the issues I had throughout the program.
